- Lichen:
    - moonlight
    - sunlight
    - sharing energy
    - storing energy

    - reproduction
        - tree and branching
        - grow direction - has chance to mutate

        - chance to spawn matrix


simple cellular automata idea:
cell increases in yellow if surrounded by red
cell increases in red if surrounded by yellow
but equalizing at orange is not good
    (can make this a slider so we can see different evolution for cbanging that rule)
    maybe orange makes both red and yellow decrease in adjacent cells
