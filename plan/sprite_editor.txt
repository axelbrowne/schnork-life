in-app sprite editor with conditional textures and coloring

- users can add a colored pixel that draws from specific values of a dorg to show a color
- what pixel this is and how the color functions works can be defined by the user
- colored pixels can be grouped to have the same color function? (not necessary, but nice for QOL)
- EUREKA
	-  every pixel has a function that defines its color including transparancy.
	- so you can add/remove the pixels if some user-defied condition is met
